# Writing README SVGs

Use SVG for deterministic layout, typography, diagrams, and title systems that must scale cleanly inside GitHub. When the user selects generated raster material inside an SVG-controlled layout, read [hybrid-svg-production.md](hybrid-svg-production.md) and publish the rendered PNG/WebP by default.

For motion, keep the SVG as the editable source and derive a GIF for GitHub playback. Read [motion-production.md](motion-production.md) before animating or converting an asset.

## Start with the canvas

Use these as starting points, not fixed templates:

```text
Hero:           1200 × 300–420
Section title:  1200 × 120–170
Diagram:        1200 × 320–760
```

Give every full-width SVG a `1200`-unit `viewBox`. Keep important content at least `48–64` units from the edges. A common hero split is roughly 58% title and 42% proof, but change it when the material needs more room.

## Design for the rendered width

The `viewBox` is a coordinate system, not a promise that GitHub will display the asset at `1200px`. A full-width `1200`-unit SVG shown in a `900px` content column is scaled to `75%`, so a `16`-unit label becomes only `12px` on screen.

Use this conversion when reviewing type:

```text
rendered size = SVG font size × displayed width ÷ viewBox width
```

For a `1200`-unit asset, use `900` CSS pixels as a conservative desktop acceptance width unless the repository's actual rendered column is narrower:

| Role | SVG size | Approx. size at 900px |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Hero or project title | `48+` | `36px+` |
| Section title | `40+` | `30px+` |
| Essential diagram or card text | `20+` | `15px+` |
| Supporting label | `18+` | `13.5px+` |
| Nonessential metadata only | `16+` | `12px+` |

Do not solve small text by changing the `viewBox` from `1200` to `900` while scaling the rest of the composition with it; the proportions stay the same. Increase the text relative to the canvas, reduce density, shorten labels, or split one dense board into multiple visuals.

Also inspect a `360px` mobile preview. A dense technical diagram may preserve its overall structure there, but any detail required to understand or use the project must remain available in the adjacent Markdown and alt text. If the image itself must carry that detail on mobile, use a taller or narrower composition instead of shrinking the labels.

## Use this file skeleton

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
     width="1200" height="320" viewBox="0 0 1200 320"
     role="img" aria-labelledby="title desc">
  <title id="title">Repository name</title>
  <desc id="desc">Plain-language description of the visual.</desc>

  <defs>
    <!-- Add only patterns, gradients, or clips that the design needs. -->
  </defs>

  <rect width="1200" height="320" rx="26" fill="#050607"/>

  <g id="title-block" transform="translate(56 40)">
    <!-- category, name, description, metadata -->
  </g>

  <g id="project-proof" transform="translate(760 40)">
    <!-- real diagram, code, specimen, or project structure -->
  </g>
</svg>
```

Name groups by role. Keep the file readable enough to edit by hand.

## Build in this order

1. Draw the background and major structural lines.
2. Place the repository name and concrete description.
3. Add the real project material.
4. Add category and repository metadata.
5. Add only the decoration still needed after the content works.

If the composition already reads clearly after step 4, stop.

## Handle typography deliberately

- Use system font stacks; do not load remote fonts.
- Use `-apple-system`, `BlinkMacSystemFont`, `Segoe UI`, `PingFang SC`, and `sans-serif` for general UI text.
- Use `ui-monospace`, `SFMono-Regular`, `Menlo`, and `monospace` for code and metadata.
- Use `Georgia`, `Songti SC`, and `serif` only when an editorial or established tone fits.
- Use size and weight for hierarchy before adding color or decoration.

SVG text does not wrap automatically. Split lines explicitly:

```svg
<text x="0" y="90">First line</text>
<text x="0" y="128">Second line</text>
```

Render after every meaningful copy change. Chinese, English, serif, and sans-serif occupy different widths; do not trust character count alone.

## Draw project material, not tech decoration

Use a small vocabulary of native SVG elements:

- `<rect>` for cards, tables, terminals, modules, and devices.
- `<circle>` for nodes, ports, states, and markers.
- `<path>` for connections, data curves, flows, and outlines.
- `<g transform="…">` to keep each component movable.
- `<clipPath>` only when content genuinely needs cropping.

Prefer a simplified version of a real architecture, relationship, code sample, output, or interface. Do not add random grids, dots, glowing lines, or circuit patterns merely to signal technology.

## Choose hand-authored SVG or a layout engine deliberately

Hand-author the SVG when the visual is compact, tightly integrated with the hero, or depends on a project-specific composition. Exact coordinates are often the simplest maintainable choice for a few boxes, a short flow, or an illustrative proof layer.

When relationship-heavy diagrams make edge routing, grouping, and label wrapping the dominant work, a structured diagram engine may be used as an optional production aid if it is already available and its license and runtime fit the project. Keep its semantic JSON or other source alongside the exported asset so later edits do not require reconstructing coordinates. The Skill must still work without that engine; do not add a tool-specific runtime as a default requirement.

For generated diagram output:

- apply the frozen project palette rather than the engine's house theme;
- use system fonts and disable remote font imports or external asset references;
- export a static SVG or PNG rather than embedding a live renderer;
- inspect the output for `<script>`, `foreignObject`, remote resources, clipped labels, and sanitizer-sensitive CSS;
- re-check the `900px` and `360px` rendered sizes above;
- when the diagram sits inside a hero, use the engine for the structural layer and keep the title composition project-native.

## Use color and effects sparingly

- Freeze direct hex values before drawing.
- Use one background, one foreground, one muted tone, and at most one or two accents unless the project is inherently colorful.
- Use gradients only when they describe material or depth; do not use them as automatic polish.
- Avoid heavy filters and shadows. For overlapping screenshots, use a low-opacity offset shape or export the composition as a raster image.
- Do not add rounded cards, top borders, or patterns to every module.

## Decide between SVG and raster

Keep the asset as SVG when it contains text, geometry, diagrams, or code-native illustration.

Export PNG/WebP when it contains:

- several screenshots or photos;
- generated artwork;
- complex image cropping or compositing;
- effects that GitHub SVG sanitization may remove.

If the title and screenshot belong together, compose them into one raster board. Keep commands, links, and long explanations in Markdown.

For hybrid composition, preserve the SVG layout and transparent raster subject as editable source layers. Do not rely on local or remote raster references inside the published SVG, and do not inflate the asset with a large base64 layer merely to keep an `.svg` extension.

## Embed in README

```html
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/readme/hero.svg" width="100%"
       alt="Repository name and a plain-language description">
</p>
```

Use a meaningful `alt`. Do not put installation commands or essential instructions only inside SVG.

## Make compact attribution feel native

After the repository owner approves the final README, offer attribution at most once as an entirely optional finishing touch. If the owner opts in, do not append a raw sentence that looks like legal fine print. Build a small project-native signature:

- Use a compact canvas around `420 × 64` and embed it at `280–320` pixels wide.
- Keep one shared information pattern: `README MADE WITH` plus `beautify-github-readme` and a restrained outbound-arrow cue.
- Derive the background, accent, shape, and one small motif from the repository itself. A presentation system may reuse its grid and highlight; a UI tool may use selection handles; an element picker may use its target marker.
- Put the signature near the README footer, usually before License. It should close the page quietly, not become another hero.
- Wrap the image in a link to `https://github.com/oil-oil/beautify-github-readme` and provide the alt text `README made with beautify-github-readme`.
- Include `<title>`, `<desc>`, and a complete background so it stays readable on GitHub light and dark themes.
- Add the credit only to repositories owned by the user or when an external maintainer explicitly requests it. Do not use it as an unsolicited backlink in third-party PRs.
- Show a rendered preview before embedding it. The signature is not required for inclusion in the upstream showcase, and declining it must not affect delivery or PR eligibility.

Recommended embed:

```html
<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/oil-oil/beautify-github-readme"><img src="./assets/readme/made-with-beautify.svg" width="300" alt="README made with beautify-github-readme"></a>
</p>
```

## Validate and inspect

Run the bundled audit:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_readme.py /path/to/repository/README.md
```

Then render every SVG and inspect it visually. On macOS, a quick local render is:

```bash
sips -s format png assets/readme/hero.svg --out /tmp/hero.png
```

Otherwise use a browser, `rsvg-convert`, or another SVG renderer. Check:

- clipped text and paths;
- text that becomes too small at GitHub width;
- weak contrast in light and dark GitHub surroundings;
- accidental decoration that competes with the project name;
- missing `<title>`, `<desc>`, `viewBox`, or alt text;
- visual material that could belong to any unrelated project.

Make one targeted change, render again, and keep the simpler version when both communicate equally well.
